####FAQ

**Q. Why is the motive of this project?**

A. I started working on this project to gain  'real development' experience, and understand problems faced by developers,       developer practices and other industry standards as I go on improving the project. Therefore my main objective is to learn
   about software programming as well as software documentation [which I just realised is way more difficult than               programming].
   
**Q. I have got this really cool suggestion that can help you improve this project/your programming. How do I contact you?**

A. Refer to the 'Connect With Me' section.

**Q.  Who is Anuj Saharan and how long has he been programming?**

A. I am a 15 year old high-schooler, currently in 11th grade at The Air Force School, New Delhi, India. Even though I started    programming in Visual Basic and HTML 4 years back, I only started learning programming in C++ this year in March. I got      into competitive programming in August of this year, and got fascinated with software development and documentation just
   a while back.

**Q. Why is the watch implemented in a console and not a graphics library?**

A. The project is in early development stage and even though I have finalised the final interface of the project [which by      the way, is not a console], I am still learning how to effectively create GUIs and port projects outside a console.

**Q. Do dolphins sleep?**

A. Yes, they are mammals and they do sleep.
