####FAQ

**Q. What is the motive of this project?**

The following is my Class XII Computer Science project. I started working on this project purely to learn and acquaint myself with common developer practices and software industry standards, by referring to various online sources as I go on building on the project’s foundation.

   
**Q. Are there any dependancies that fuel this project?**

The Watch Project makes use of the CTime library for time input purposes, as well as the <windows.h> header to efficiently draw the watch onto the console.

**Q. Why is the watch implemented in a console and not a graphics library?**

As a novice programmer, I am still learning how to effectively create GUIs using graphics libraries and thus, a console seems to be a very apt placeholder.

**Q. Do dolphins sleep?**

Yes, they are mammals and they do sleep.
